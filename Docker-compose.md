# Orchestrate Containers for Development with Docker Compose


The docker cli is used when managing individual containers on a docker engine. 
It is the client command line to access the docker daemon api.

The docker-compose cli can be used to manage a multi-container application. It also moves many of the options you would enter on the docker run cli into the docker-compose.yml file for easier reuse. It works as a front end "script" on top of the same docker api used by docker, s
o you can do everything docker-compose does with docker commands and a lot of shell scripting.
